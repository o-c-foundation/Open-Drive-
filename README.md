## Overview

OpenDrive is a next-generation decentralized storage platform built on content-addressing principles to provide secure, resilient, and censorship-resistant file storage. Developed by The Open Crypto Foundation, OpenDrive leverages distributed networks to ensure your data remains accessible and tamper-evident.

### Why OpenDrive?

- **Content-Addressed Storage**: Files are identified by their cryptographic hash, not by location, ensuring content integrity and authenticity
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure or control
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Every file is cryptographically verified using advanced algorithms
- **Intuitive Interface**: Modern, responsive design with seamless user experience
- **Flexible Storage Plans**: From free personal use to enterprise-scale solutions

## Features

- üì§ **Simple File Upload**: Drag-and-drop or browser-based file selection
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Email-based verification with private key security
- üìÇ **Directory Support**: Upload entire folders while preserving structure
- üîÑ **Versioning**: Track changes to files over time
- üîç **Easy Retrieval**: Access your files from anywhere with content-based addressing
- üìä **Storage Management**: Monitor usage and manage your storage allocation
- üì± **Mobile Responsive**: Access from any device with our responsive interface

## Technical Foundation

OpenDrive is built on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) technology, which provides content-addressed storage through distributed hash tables and directed acyclic graphs. This gives your data several advantages:

- Content is retrieved based on what it is, not where it is
- Files are automatically deduplicated across the network
- Built-in versioning through content-addressing
- Resilience against network partitions and censorship

For developers, OpenDrive offers:
- TypeScript-based architecture with strict typing
- React components for seamless integration
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access

## Getting Started

To begin using OpenDrive, simply:

1. Visit [app.opendrive.opencrypto.org](https://app.opendrive.opencrypto.org)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Start uploading your files
4. Share content using content-addressed links

For developers wanting to contribute to the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opencryptofoundation/opendrive.git
cd opendrive

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
cd app
